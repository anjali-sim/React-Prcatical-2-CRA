# React-Practical-2

- For this Practical, I have designed the User Interface(UI) for the Todo list. 
- I have divided the webpage into four components 
  - Main or Parent component
  - Navigation Bar
  - Todo List Items
  - Button 
- I have created the project using CRA. I have made the UI matching exactly with the UI that was provided. 
- The UI is responsive which means creating web pages that look good on all devices. 
- I have used the date object to implement the date functionality.
- I have used the <strong>styled component</strong> to include the CSS for the components. I have included the global style as well.
- I have followed the proper naming conventions, formatting and commenting.
